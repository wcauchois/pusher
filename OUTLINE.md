This program would consist of two things: an Android app and
a web application. The idea is that you can push questions to
yourself (as Android notifications) at specified time intervals.
These questions would be simple yes/no (or possible terniary)
quesitons like "Did you have lunch today?". When you answer the question,
it uploads the answer to the web application where you can view/graph
your answers over time. You can also configure the questions/intervals
on the web appplication and they will get pushed to the app's
configuration. The only thing the app does really is just handle
the notifications. The only configuration option in the app is
to point it to your server.
